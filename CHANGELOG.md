- [[#110](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/pull/110)] `LegendGroupTitle` to existing traces.
- [[#88](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/pull/88)] `Mesh3D`, `Image`, `ScatterMapbox` traces.

### Changed
- [[#113](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/pull/113)] Refactored the structure of the examples to make them more accessible, whilst adding more examples e.g. for `wasm`.
- [[#115](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/pull/115)] Simplify the function signature of Plot.to_inline_html() so that it just takes `Option<&str>` as an argument.

## [0.8.1] - 2022-09-25
### Added
- Button support (i.e. [updatemenus](https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/layout/updatemenus/)) contibuted by [@sreenathkrishnan](https://github.com/sreenathkrishnan). Details and examples in this well written PR [#99](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/pull/99).
- Internally, there is now a `plotly-derive` crate which defines a `FieldSetter` procedural macro. This massively cuts down the amount of code duplication by generating the setter methods based on the struct fields. Again thanks to @sreenathkrishnan for this effort.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-08-26
Version 0.8.0 represents a significant release which refactors a lot of the codebase and tries to provide a cleaner API: there are several breaking changes listed below. On the whole, if migrating from v0.7.0, start by following any new compiler errors and, if you're still stuck, open an issue on the issue tracker and we can help out.
### Added
- impl `Clone`, `Serialize` and `PartialEq` for `Plot`
- impl `Clone` +/- `Copy` for color types
- Support for [configuration options](https://plotly.com/javascript/configuration-options/)
- Support for layout templates and pre-defined themes
- Support for WASM environments
- A much enhanced test suite
- Support for `Sankey` diagrams
- Support for `Plot3D` - 3D plots for scatter, line and surface data
### Changed
- Improve implementation of `private::NumOrString` to support more primitive types ([Issue 
#47](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/issues/47))
- Remove `private::TruthyEnum` in favour of a more robust way of serializing to `String` or `bool`
- Refactor `Color` module
- Refactored HTML templates with cleaner Javascript code
- `Plot::save()` is renamed to `Plot::write_image()`
- `Plot::show_{png | jpeg}` is now made generic via the new `Plot::show_image()` across static image formats with the `ImageFormat` enum
- `Plot::write_html()` now takes a filepath and saves the plot to that location
- `Plot::to_html()` now has similar behaviour to `Plot::to_inline_html()` and just returns a `String`
### Fixed
- Typos in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Serialization of `plotly_kaleido::PlotData` ([Issue #50](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly/issues/50))

The message suggests a few alternatives.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-02-27
### Added
- Documentation for `Plot`

    - All plots `Trace`s are now accessible from the main namespace `plotly::`.
    - Enums and structs common to more than 1 plot type and/or the `Layout` now live in `plotly::common::`
    - Internal methods and structs that are not considered part of the public API are now in `plotly::private::`
